## The "Molt" Concept

Leaning into the transformation/growth theme:

### Evolution Tracking
- Track how usage patterns change over time
- Visualize growth in capabilities and knowledge
- Show progression from basic assistant to personalized AI companion

### Skill Unlocking
- As Moltbot learns preferences, new capabilities unlock
- Gamification of assistant relationship
- Achievement system for milestones

### Growth Reports
- Monthly digest of what Moltbot learned
- Insights into conversation patterns
- Suggestions for better utilization

### Shedding Old Patterns
- Suggest deprecated workflows to clean up
- Archive stale memories
- Optimize context based on actual usage

### Transformation Modes
- **Productivity Molt**: Focus on task completion, minimal chat
- **Creative Molt**: Brainstorming, ideation, exploration
- **Research Molt**: Deep investigation, source gathering
- **Learning Molt**: Teaching mode, explanations, tutorials
